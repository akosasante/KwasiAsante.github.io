      <article>
        <p>Hi! My name is Kwasi Asante I am an aspiring game developer currently studying Game Programming at Humber
          College in Toronto.
        <p>My passion for programming (and computers in general) started at a very young age due to both of my parents
          own involvment in the field.
        <p>Through my studies and personal projects, I hold a good understanding of programming in C#, C++, Java, HTML,
          CSS and JavaScript.
        <p>I studied Game Programming at Humber College in Toronto, where I had the opportunity to expand both my
          experience and my knowledge of best practices in these languages through the development of many types of
          video games.
        <p>To that end, I also participate in "Game Jams" to increase my abilities to work with a team and absorb
          lessons and experience that were previously unknown to me.
        <p>Currently, I am taking more leadership roles by being the Lead Programmer in my current project. Below I have
          included links to my projects, my resume, and some links to contact me.
        <p>Take a look around and feel free to reach out to me to discuss any of my projects.

              <p>Cadescent Aether is a colorful rock-paper-scissors wave 2-player game with energetic rhythme mechanics
                to give the game a mix of challenge and strategy. Each player must navigate between the three lanes and
                send out a pair of of three shapes to send out against their foe. Both players have a choice of three
                shapes; shpere, cube, and triangluar-prism with each shape able defeat the other. The goal of the game
                is to get as many shapes into your opponsite's side within the time limit.</p>
              <p>Cadescent Aether was made during the 2017 Global Game Jam from January 20-22. I worked along side 3
                other programmers and took the role as the mechanics developer. I created and polished the
                rokc-paper-scissors mechanics and player controls. I also ironed out and fine tuned the rules and lane
                movement mechanics. I also assisted my other team memebers in endvaours such as menu ui and
                debugging.</p>

              <p>Tuber Tyrants is a fun 4 player survivial platform with cartoon visuals and referenctial humour. Each
                player controls a tuber, each repsresenting a political leader, and try to jump on to the on coming
                platforms; the surviving tuber is declared the winner. However the game will throw random challenges
                known as "Alternate Facts" to the game to add difficulty to players and inviting an more intense and
                exciting experience.</p>
