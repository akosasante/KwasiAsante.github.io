    <p>Cadescent Aether is a colorful rock-paper-scissors wave 2-player game with energetic rhythme mechanics to give
      the game a mix of challenge and strategy. Each player must navigate between the three lanes and send out a pair of
      of three shapes to send out against their foe. Both players have a choice of three shapes; shpere, cube, and
      triangluar-prism with each shape able defeat the other. The goal of the game is to get as many shapes into your
      opponsite's side within the time limit.</p>
    <p>Cadescent Aether was made during the 2017 Global Game Jam from January 20-22. I worked along side 3 other
      programmers and took the role as the mechanics developer. I created and polished the rokc-paper-scissors mechanics
      and player controls. I also ironed out and fine tuned the rules and lane movement mechanics. I also assisted my
      other team memebers in endvaours such as menu ui and debugging.</p>
